  <summary>3. Dash Mantine Components is based on REACT 18
what is react 18</summary>

  
  React 18 is a version of **React**, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, released in **March 2022**. It introduced several new features and improvements, with a focus on **performance**, **developer experience**, and **concurrent rendering** capabilities. Below is an overview of the key features and concepts in React 18:

---

### **Key Features of React 18**

#### 1. **Concurrent Rendering**
   - Concurrent rendering allows React to prepare multiple versions of the UI at the same time without blocking the main thread. This enables smoother updates and better responsiveness, particularly in complex applications.
   - It powers features like **Transitions**, which allow React to distinguish between urgent and non-urgent updates.

#### 2. **Automatic Batching**
   - In React 18, state updates are automatically batched, meaning multiple state updates within a single event are grouped into one re-render.
   - This reduces unnecessary renders, improving performance.

   ```javascript
   // Before React 18
   setCount(count + 1);
   setFlag(true); // Causes two separate re-renders

   // In React 18
   setCount(count + 1);
   setFlag(true); // One re-render only
   ```

#### 3. **Start Transition**
   - React 18 introduces a new `startTransition` API to mark updates as "non-urgent," ensuring that urgent updates (e.g., input typing) are prioritized.

   ```javascript
   import { startTransition } from "react";

   startTransition(() => {
     setState(newState);
   });
   ```

#### 4. **Streaming Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
   - React 18 improves server-side rendering with **streaming support**, allowing components to be rendered and sent to the client incrementally.
   - This reduces Time-to-Interactive (TTI) for server-rendered applications.

#### 5. **New `useId` Hook**
   - The `useId` hook generates unique IDs for accessibility purposes or server-side rendering, ensuring IDs are consistent across client and server.

   ```javascript
   import { useId } from "react";

   const id = useId();
   ```

#### 6. **Strict Mode Improvements**
   - React 18 runs additional checks in development mode, including mounting, unmounting, and re-mounting components, to help identify potential side-effects.

---

### **Migration to React 18**
Upgrading to React 18 is relatively straightforward for most applications. However, to fully leverage new features like concurrent rendering, libraries and frameworks (such as Dash Mantine Components) must be updated to align with React 18â€™s APIs and behavior.

---

### **Why Is React 18 Relevant for Dash Mantine Components?**
Dash Mantine Components uses **React 18** as its foundation because:
- React 18 supports **Concurrent Rendering**, enabling smoother UI updates in Dash applications.
- Mantine, a React-based UI library, benefits from the performance optimizations in React 18.

If you're using Dash Mantine Components, you should ensure that your environment supports React 18 to take advantage of these improvements.
